    <div id="sourceText">America. Online. is. one. of. the. big. names. on. the. internet,. and. unlike. many. other. digital. companies,. it. actually. makes. a. profit.. But. the. company. which. its. rivals. call. the. "Cyber-cockroach". was. launched. only. in. 1992.. Before. that. it. was. a. small. firm. called. Control. Video. Corporation,. and. it. made. video. games.. Then. Steve. Case,. a. former. Pizza. Hut. marketing. executive. arrived. and. took. the. company. online.. Innovative,. fast. moving,. and. user-friendly,. America. Online. appeals. to. people. who. want. to. surf. the. internet,. but. who. do. not. have. a. lot. of. experience.. For. the. same. reason. "techies",. people. who. think. they. are. more. expert. with. computers,. look. down. on. America. Online. and. its. users.. Recently. America. Online. (or. AOL,. as. it. calls. itself). joined. with. Time. Warner. -. a. multi-million. dollar. movie. and. magazine. company. -. to. create. a. multimedia. giant.. Now,. AOL. has. begun. to. expand. abroad.. In. many. European. countries,. including. the. United. Kingdom,. it. is. hard. to. buy. a. computer. magazine. that. does. not. have. a. free. AOL. introductory. offer.. The. company. also. puts. advertisements. onto. the. television,. and. employs. people. to. hand. out. its. free. introductory. disks. at. places. like. train. stations.. As. the. internet. gets. faster. AOL. is. changing.. With. many. homes. getting. high-speed. connections. through. fibre. optic. cables. or. the. new. ASDL. technology,. the. "Cyber-cockroach". will. have. to. show. that,. like. real. cockroaches,. it. can. survive. in. almost. any. environment.</div>
